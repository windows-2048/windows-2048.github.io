Hi! My name is Masha Novedad. I am open source programmer since 2016. I write in vanilla C++.
I am an author of The Fastest Mouse Clicker for Windows.
All my applications are compact, standalone and statically-linked thus they have no external dependencies.
Windows installers are made for your convenience by open source tool [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php){:target="_blank"}.
Welcome to download my flagship product!
