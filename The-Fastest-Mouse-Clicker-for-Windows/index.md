<a name="FAQ"></a>
## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Does the clicker work when its main GUI window is minimized?

Yes, it does. Trigger keys are being intercepted and mouse events are being emitted
regardless the application window state is: normal, maximized, minimized, focus, blur, etc.

### What if I want to emulate 2 clicks within every 3 seconds, what the 'clicks per second' parameter should be?

You have to type 0.67 inside 'clicks per second' input field. Just click on it, delete previous value, and type new one.

### What is minimal Windows version supported?

Your PC must have Windows 7 or later. Don't use Windows XP. Better use Windows 10. Windows 11 is also supported.

### When I open many windows simultaneously on my desktop and start to emulate mouse clicks, I lose the GUI window of the app. Why?

That's because you forget about checkbox named "Window Always Top". It is specially designed to prevent such a situation.
Once you check it, main GUI window of the program will be layered always topmost (above all the other windows on your desktop).

### What about sequences of clicks?

Work with sequences of clicks is supported since v2.5.x.x. To avoid GUI complication, second "Group" application is implemented.
To run that app from main "Single" app just press a "Run group app" button. To return to main app press "Run single app" button.

### Does your program run on bare Windows, like Windows Home on a laptop just from store?

Yes. Unlike all other auto-clickers this app is statically linked and has no external dependencies (e.g. "The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b)" from incorrect linkage against MSVC run-time DLLs).

### Does your app support multiple subsequent mouse clicks?

Yes, it does. But the Help text is not ready yet. Although the GUI is simple and intuitive
and based on the one of the most famous auto-clickers in the past. To do subsequent clicking,
just run the main app, click the "Run group app" button and see the "Quick Help" area just below the center of the window.

### I observe many other auto-clickers do not support 4K displays. What about your one?

I did that work essentially and have fixed that issue by adjusting font sizes on the fly and embedding a proper xml manifest into app binary.

### Is this FAQ nearly complete?

Oh no :) It has been just started. Feel free to ask your question via email. See the Contacts chapter below.
