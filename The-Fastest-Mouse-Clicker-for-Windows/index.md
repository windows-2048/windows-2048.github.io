time needed to build your own universe in your favorite game is comparable to the time of existence of our Universe, metaphorically said.
Here why The Fastest Mouse Clicker for Windows comes to the scene.

Industry standard free open source mouse auto clicker emulates Windows clicks EXTREMELY QUICKLY via arrays of 1-1000 mouse events in Win32 <code><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-sendinput" target="_blank">SendInput()</a></code>, making up to 100 000 clicks per second. Brand new group clicking support, Command line for batch files, Auto-save on exit, Random clicking, App's window always topmost are supported. This compact standalone program is compiled and statically linked by gnu/gcc compiler and supports all the Windows 7 to 10 and Linux via Wine emulator. This clicker is the best for incremental games: Cooking, Soda, Minecraft etc.

The program is written in vanilla C++ with native Win32 API and linked statically thus it becomes a super-compact executable without external dependencies and can run on a bare Windows installation.

Free and fast, open source, full-featured, statically-linked mouse auto clicker for Windows written in vanilla C++. Uses hardware-limited arrayed Win32 <code><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-sendinput" target="_blank">SendInput()</a></code> calls to reach up to 100000 clicks/s. Supports command line, random clicks and record-play the sequences of clicks.

This is a professional tool for both quality assistance workflow and video game cheating.
Using keyboard keys (or mouse buttons) as a trigger, you can position the mouse, then hit a key to click up to 100000 times every second,
10 times faster then abandoned project at [sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fastclicker/){:target="_blank"}.
{{ site.t['app_name'][page.lang] }} allows you to set an activation key to switch automatic clicking . There are two activation modes:
"press": the app will repeat clicking as long as the activation key is being pressed, and
"toggle": a Begin activation key press activates automatic clicking until an End activation key press deactivates it.
Of course, you can select arbitrary Begin and End trigger keys.
You also have the option to set a click number limitation. The mouse auto-clicker stops automatically when your desired number of clicks is reached.

> New big version with FIXED POSITION CLICKING has been released!

{{ site.t['app_name'][page.lang] }} clicks the mouse automatically by emulating mouse clicking events.
The app has random in a box clicking feature, if you want that for some reason.
I plan to implement variative time interval between the clicks and allow you to choose a random interval range.
Hotkeys that trigger mouse clicks will be supported with almost every key modifiers, like SHIFT, CONTROL and ALT thus allow you to have SHIFT+\<Key\>, CONTROL+\<Key\> and ALT+\<Key\> triggers.
{{ site.t['app_name'][page.lang] }} is now suitable for Minecraft and Roblox auto-clicking, thanks to request from Xisuma user.
Also the program can be used as autoplayer for the game ClickerHeroes.
It can autoclick, activate skills, buy heroes and upgrades, and ascend and start all over.
All you need is to record and playback appropriate clicking sequence (see below).

You can auto-click the images, auto-fill the web forms, auto-submit a various type of requests with this auto-clicker.
For example, {{ site.t['app_name'][page.lang] }} can be used for scripting in Steam Summer Monster Minigame.
Another example, this program can be a bot for PTC websites like shorte.st, linkbucks, admy.link, etc. that automatically skips Ads.
The Group Clicker is a part of {{ site.t['app_name'][page.lang] }}. To run this extension simply click on "Run group app" button on the main window of {{ site.t['app_name'][page.lang] }}.
To return back to the previous app, click "Run single app" button.
The Group Clicker helps you to maintain separate sheet of data file from which Group Clicker can fetch data and use them row by row.
Also I plan to implement a schedule stored in a plain text file allowing you to auto-click on a webpage/URL at particular day and time.
You may add your own features by opening the solution file in Visual Studio and modifying source code.
The Windows installer opens corresponding folders by default.

Here is a short intro video that tells how to download and install {{ site.t['app_name'][page.lang] }}.

<a name="FAQ"></a>
## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Does the clicker work when its main GUI window is minimized?

Yes, it does. Trigger keys are being intercepted and mouse events are being emitted
regardless the application window state is: normal, maximized, minimized, focus, blur, etc.

### What if I want to emulate 2 clicks within every 3 seconds, what the 'clicks per second' parameter should be?

You have to type 0.67 inside 'clicks per second' input field. Just click on it, delete previous value, and type new one.

### What is minimal Windows version supported?

Your PC must have Windows 7 or later. Don't use Windows XP. Better use Windows 10. Windows 11 is also supported.

### When I open many windows simultaneously on my desktop and start to emulate mouse clicks, I lose the GUI window of the app. Why?

That's because you forget about checkbox named "Window Always Top". It is specially designed to prevent such a situation.
Once you check it, main GUI window of the program will be layered always topmost (above all the other windows on your desktop).

### What about sequences of clicks?

Work with sequences of clicks is supported since v2.5.x.x. To avoid GUI complication, second "Group" application is implemented.
To run that app from main "Single" app just press a "Run group app" button. To return to main app press "Run single app" button.

### Does your program run on bare Windows, like Windows Home on a laptop just from store?

Yes. Unlike all other auto-clickers this app is statically linked and has no external dependencies (e.g. "The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b)" from incorrect linkage against MSVC run-time DLLs).

### Does your app support multiple subsequent mouse clicks?

Yes, it does. But the Help text is not ready yet. Although the GUI is simple and intuitive
and based on the one of the most famous auto-clickers in the past. To do subsequent clicking,
just run the main app, click the "Run group app" button and see the "Quick Help" area just below the center of the window.

### I observe many other auto-clickers do not support 4K displays. What about your one?

I did that work essentially and have fixed that issue by adjusting font sizes on the fly and embedding a proper xml manifest into app binary.

### Is this FAQ nearly complete?

Oh no :) It has been just started. Feel free to ask your question via email. See the Contacts chapter below.
