Apart of mouse event emulation techniques, it is important to know about so called Mouse Polling Rate.
Mouse Polling Rate is the frequency at which your mouse signals the computer its whereabouts on the screen.
For instance, a mouse with its polling rate set to 125Hz will refresh its location on screen 125 times per second.
The higher the polling rate, the more "real-time" the cursor movement that you see on the screen will be.
Depending on mouse manufacturer, your Mouse Polling Rate may vary from some 100Hz to up to 1000Hz and more.

From what you’ve learned so far about polling rates, it’s easy to see why a higher polling rate would benefit a gaming mouse.
But note, the difference between 125Hz and 500Hz is much more significant than between 500Hz and 1000Hz.
In the latter case you get benefit of a just 1ms. Thus there is no reason to buy an expensive mouse with polling rate much greater than 500Hz.
Moreover, it has been found that high polling rates of 1000Hz or more tend to put a heavier load on the CPU.

Here I leave an intriguing thoughts on mouse polling rates and auto-clicker software, came from one of the fan user of {{ site.t['app_name'][page.lang] }}.

Hey Masha, Thanks for the reply, I saw the download on Majorgeeks, but I believe I downloaded it from your site to make sure I had the latest version, that's how I got your email address too. Anyway, the "polling rate" is basically how fast your mouse sends signals to your PC of it's current location, it's usually measured in Hz, my Logitech software has options for 125 Hz, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, and 1000 Hz, as does most other mouse gaming software and there are a few utilities that can change it the polling rate too, 1000 Hz has been the limit for a long time, but now companies like Razer, has a mouse with a polling rate of 8000 Hz, some other 2000 Hz .. I'm just looking for something that will achieve over 1000 Hz. Basically, the higher the polling rate, the less "mouse lag" while gaming. I also do things like set the process priority level for my mouse driver/software process to "above normal" or "high" to get more responsiveness from it.

I downloaded a couple of other mouse programs like yours, one I tried so far is "Speed Auto Clicker" .. it's okay, it does do what I want as far as "click speed", but I don't like the button assignment options, you can only assign hotkeys to "keyboard buttons", I have a mouse with 10 buttons, I want the option on the fly (on my mouse). I tried contacting him, email was sent back undeliverable and program hasn't been updated in a while, so it's development has probably ended.

I'm going to try yours shortly, I also tried the other I downloaded, or lets says I opened it, it's called AutoFire and it's kinda weird ... not sure it will do what I want in the games I play. Plus... I am hoping none of these get detect as cheats... I have a perfect record with Valve Software / Steam, had my acct. for 19 yrs, don't want to loose it!

Hopefully your program while do what I want ... what I "really want" is a utility that just makes "one mouse click" equal a higher number, like "3 mouse clicks, or 5, 10, etc..", kinda like how you can set your scroll wheel to either scroll 1 line at a time, or 2 lines, or 3 lines at a time. Same thing, I just want that option for my mouse clicker (left click).

None I downloaded have the polling rate options, I do have 2 utilities that adjust polling rates, but they are from 2010 and 2011, not sure if they'll work with modern OS's, plus they do not exceed 1000 Hz and my Logitech G-Hub software allows me to set @ 1000 Hz, but I want higher! I was thinking about seeing if I can edit the polling rate utility from 2010, its a small simple utility and hopefully I can edit the values. I'm no developer, but I have played around with it some and successfully edited and altered programs / drivers, when WinXP Pro x64 bit first came out, I was using it, I actually beta tested it for 14 months before it's release too, but XP Pro x64 was the "first x64 bit" OS to hit the shelves, in OEM form, but anyone could buy it, I got mine free for testing, but driver support was extremely limited and I had a high end gaming machine, most of my hardware and add-ons had driver support either from the manufacturer, like nVidia released x64 bit drivers, others had native support from the OS, but my favorite audio card by Creative would not work and I hated onboard audio back then, it took me about 4 days, but I was able to modify some of the .inf and .sys files and got the "audio" to work, none of the other features worked and I had no equalizer, etc..

But I did get the sound to work. I wish I got in to it more, I'm pretty good with computers, especially on the hardware side, I've been building them since 1996, my current rig I built cost me $3,800.00 to build, but some of that cost was inflated prices due to graphics card shortages, I paid $1,000.00 for a card that would normally retail @ $399.99. But the rest was priced fairly I believe, I've got a 12 core 5900x Ryzen processor, 64gb of Corsair RGB 3600 mhz ddr4, 1tb Samsung 980 Pro NVMe SSD, Geforce 3060 Ti OCX, ASUS TUF Gaming x570 Plus WiFi motherboard, etc... but I'm good a figuring out stuff on PC's on the software side, like manually removing stubborn trojans, malware, ransomeware, etc..

Anyway, enough babbling, I'll let you know what I think of it and if it does what I wanted or not... thanks for your reply!
